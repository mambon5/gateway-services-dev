# Test 1 gateway-gateway on off

Experiment: 

1. We have one *gateway 1* with the sink and with two nodes 1,2 connected to it
2. We have another *gateway 2* with the sink and with two other nodes 3,4  connected to it

3. We Power off *gateway 1*
4. We wait *1min 30 sec*
5. The nodes *1,2* connected using Wirepas to *gateway 2* and are ready to receive commands and send information on their performance

# Test 2 gateway-gateway 4-0

Experiment: 

1. We have one *gateway 1* with the sink and with four nodes 1,2,3,4 connected to it
2. We have another *gateway 2* with the sink and with no node connected to it.

3. We Power on *gateway 2* and the 4 nodes are close to both gateways
4. We wait *1min 30 sec*
5. The nodes *1,2* connected using Wirepas to *gateway 2* and are ready to receive commands and send information on their performance
